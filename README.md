## Overview

### Screenshot

## My process

I started with the html structuring and then after getting a nice little card in the middle i began to design from the outside in. Start with centering the image and text. I changed the background colors and added some border radius to the card. Continued down this path. Nothing too crazy to note for this process.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties / live precompiler with VS Code extension
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Making a small card element is great practice on how to make something responsive
and learn how to imagin the html in your head as you are building. It is a great
little first project and I am excited to challenge myself more now.


### Continued development

I am pumped to continue to get better at making better resusable elements and start doing more JS as well.
